#  AeroScan.AI

AeroScan.AI presents a highly sophisticated framework designed for the precise detection and categorization of anomalies in aircraft surface inspection. 

Finding defects in large surfaces poses a formiddable challenge when the defects are only few pixels wide.

This prototype aims to reduce the congnitive burden on the inspectors by leveraging AI-based solutions. 
 
Specifically, AeroScan.AI is a multi-phase solution that fuses models from different modalities including 3d-scans, time-series waveform, and tabular data to form an effecient for industrial aircraft inspection. The protoype also provides feasability to readily scale to any application hat deals with large 3D-data data
